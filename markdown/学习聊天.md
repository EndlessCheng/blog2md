> You pull into the parking lot, turn off the engine, and sit for a minute
dreading the next two hours. An important client has invited you to an open
house in celebration of their new downtown office. You hate these things. You
don’t know what to say, you don’t know anyone except the client, and you
always feel like you’re trying not to look lost; so you eat and drink more
than you should, just to stay occupied. You must attend—that’s a given—but you
sink deeper into the front seat and agonize over how long you have to stay.

节选自《the fine art of small talk》第一章“What’s the Big Deal About Small Talk?”。我真的很
苦恼于无话可说，心里明明有与对方亲近的意愿，却完全不知如何让话题起死回生。好不容易想到一个话题跟对方进行的很愉快，却又开始担心这个话题说完了该说些什么，如果
想不到备胎，心里还是会焦虑。

这几天好好看看这本书。
